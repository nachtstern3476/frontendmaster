## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- A little bit of Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanila JS

### What I learned

In this challenge i tried to use semantic HTML5 markup and using vanila js for fething data in `data.json` file.

I also start putting an effort on how to make the css code as DRY as posible by writing only necessary style only.

Well for now it's not perfect yet but practice makes improvement, so let's gooo to the next challange....

### Continued development

For the next challenge i will keep using semantic HTML5 and css.

With the goal is to be good at writing html and css. Not only create and style a good website but create and style a good and working website
